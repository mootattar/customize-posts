A lightweight plugin that allows you to highlight post titles and/or excerpts with custom labels and background colors, based on tags.

== Description ==

**Post Label Styler** is a simple, fast, and lightweight WordPress plugin that lets you visually highlight posts using custom styles.

With this plugin, you can:

- Add a colored label next to the post title.
- Change the text color and background color of the label.
- Apply a background color to the post excerpt (description).
- Choose whether to apply styles to the title, excerpt, or both.

All of this is done easily from the WordPress admin dashboard. Simply specify the tag (term) you want to style, and every post that contains that tag will be automatically styled with the defined colors and label.

You can edit or remove the styles at any time.
